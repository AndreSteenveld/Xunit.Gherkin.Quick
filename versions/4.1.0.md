# 4.1.0

Bug fixes:

- Support for datatable arguments for scanario outline steps. For more info, link to the issue: https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick/issues/102
- Async void step methods did not really execute until this fix (async Task and synchronous void were fine!). The change disallows such methods to avoid accidental mistakes. For more info, link to the issue: https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick/issues/104
